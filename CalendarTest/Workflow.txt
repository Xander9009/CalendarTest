Theoretically needed steps:
Step 1: Get a list of saved users.
Step 2a: Choose an existing user or choose to add a new one.
Step 2b: If adding a new user, add user to list.
Step 3a: Load user's tokens, if they exist.
Step 3b: If tokens don't exist, authorize new tokens.
Step 4: Use tokens to access TSheets and mirror updates to Google Calendar.



Step 1: Get a list of saved users.
A file containing the list of known users needs to exist. Likely simply "users.json".
That file needs to contain each user's:
	display name -> selection dialog
	ID -> used in the saving of both Google Calendar and TSheets token filenames.
Getting the list is easy enough.
